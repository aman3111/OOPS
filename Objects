OBJECT:

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental building block that represents a real-world entity or a concept within a program. 
It is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint or template defining the object's structure and behavior.

JAVA CODE:

/** class code **/

    class Dog {
        String name;
        String breed;

        void bark() {
            System.out.println(name + " barks!");
        }
    }


/** object code **/


// Creating an object (instance) of the Dog class
Dog myDog = new Dog();
