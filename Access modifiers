Access modifiers: 

Access modifiers in Java are keywords that control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and constructors within a Java application. 
They are crucial for implementing encapsulation, a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that restricts direct access to an object's internal components. 


There are four primary access modifiers in Java: 

public:
Visibility: Accessible from any other class in the application, regardless of the package.
Scope: Widest scope, allowing universal access.


private:
Visibility: Accessible only within the class where they are declared.
Scope: Most restricted scope, limiting access to the defining class.


protected:
Visibility: Accessible within the same package and in subclasses, even if the subclasses are in different packages.
Scope: Allows controlled access, particularly useful for inheritance scenarios.


default (no modifier):
Visibility: Accessible only to other classes within the same package.
Scope: Limits visibility to the package level. Also known as "package-private."

These modifiers are essential for managing how data and methods are accessed and modified, contributing to the development of secure, maintainable, 
and well-structured Java code.
