Encapsulation: 

Encapsulation is a core object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that bundles data and the methods (functions) that 
operate on that data into a single unit, like a class, and restricts direct access to the data. This "bundling" is often achieved by making 
internal data private and providing public "getter" and "setter" methods for controlled access.


JAVA CODE:

class BankAccount {
    private String password;   // private field

    public void setPassword(String password) { // setter
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getPassword() { // getter
        return password;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();
        acc.setPassword("mySecret123");    // setting private data
        System.out.println("Password: " + acc.getPassword()); // accessing safely
    }
}
